# khanna.cc site

This site is generated by Jekyll using the [beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) theme.
I try to modify the files provided by that theme as little as possible, other than this README file, obviously.
I try only to add to the repo to make it easy to merge upstream changes. For example, I added a `custom.css` but did not modify `main.css`.

## How to Add a Blog Post
- Checkout new branch for the post. 
- From the project root, run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- Duplicate a file in the _posts directory, but rename it. Keep the filename date as today.
- Write the post.
- Update the timestamp in the post and the date in the post filename to the publication date.
- If it's not showing up, look to see if the timestamp is in the future. Post won't be generated if it is in the future.
- Merge the changes into master and delete the branch.
- Push the repo to origin

## How to Add a Note
- No need to make a new branch since these notes will be updated all the time.
- From the project root, run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- Duplicate a file in the notes/ directory, but rename it.
- Add the note to notes/index.html
- Write the note.
- Push the repo to origin

## Things to Do
- TODO: Have notes just be part of jekyll's "collections" rather than static pages. The benefit is that I no longer will need to manually add the note to the notes/index.html.
- TODO: Submit a PR for the page.head-title attribute I added
